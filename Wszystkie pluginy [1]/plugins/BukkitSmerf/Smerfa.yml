# Welcome in configuration file of my plugin! :> some info:
#     useLogIt/useAuthme/useXAuth: plugin used to auto-login players with premium - LogIt is the best :>
#     autoProtect: if you enable that, then every no-premium user will be saved, and if someone buy premium for that nickname - that will be still account of that no-premium user, but if player use correct password - then will be updated to premium user. (don't work with xAuth)
#     exceptions: players from that list will be logged as no-premium, even if nickname is premium - use that to protect some players!
#     enabledLogin: Players from that list must login even if they have premium.
#     offlineWhiteListEnabled: enable white-list for no-premium players, if true then only players from that list can join to server. (works only for no-premium, premium can join even if is in list)
#     offlineWhiteList: white-list.
#     offlineBlackList: Players from that list can't join to server (works only for no-premium, premium can join even if is in list) RASIZM! :P
